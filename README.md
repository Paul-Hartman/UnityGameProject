# Avalanche
This is a Game that I made using Unity for the final game project of the Unity course on the Tech Academy Bootcamp. You play as a disgruntled christmas donkey causing an avalanche. You play by rolling down a mountain and hitting little balls that then spawn more snowballs that roll down with you and gain size as they do. The Goal is to destroy all of the houses at the bottom of the mountain.
